Continuous Deployment with Ant
==============================

This is just a small mock to demonstrate that mindset beats tools when it comes to DevOps and Continuous Delivery. In practice many people just think too much about which tools to use to do DevOps and Continuous Delivery instead of just doing it - using the tools the already have.

In this example a simple build.xml for [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) is used to demonstrate how Continuous Delivery can be done with different tools.

Of course you can also do this with [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or maybe [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) if you feel so - or even with a very simple shell script.
